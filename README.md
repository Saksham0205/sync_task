# Project SyncTask: A Collaborative Task Management Platform

## Abstract

Project SyncTask is a mobile application, built using the Flutter framework, designed to merge personal task management with social accountability. The application will provide users with a private space for their daily tasks while introducing a "Common Task" feature where users can create or join shared tasks with friends. The primary objective is to increase user motivation and task completion by visualizing shared progress and fostering a collaborative environment. This document outlines the market opportunity, technical architecture, core features, and a strategic plan for AI-driven differentiation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional to-do list applications are often isolating. While effective for personal organization, they fail to leverage a key human motivator: social accountability. Users lack a simple, integrated way to share specific goals with friends, track mutual progress, and create a sense of shared accomplishment, which can lead to higher rates of procrastination and task abandonment.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

We propose a cross-platform mobile application that treats task management as both a personal and a social activity. The app will have two distinct modules:

- **"My Tasks"**: A private, user-specific to-do list.
- **"Common Tasks"**: A social module where users can create "Task Groups," invite friends, add shared tasks, and see in real-time who has completed each task.

### 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of this research and development project are:

- To develop a single-codebase application for both iOS and Android using Flutter.
- To implement a real-time backend to instantly sync task status across all group members' devices.
- To design a simple, intuitive UI that clearly separates personal and social tasks.
- To establish a scalable and secure database schema to manage users, friendships, and tasks.

## 2. Literature Review and Market Analysis

### 2.1 Competitive Landscape

Before committing to development, we must understand the existing market. Our analysis reveals the market is segmented, presenting a clear opportunity. The competitive landscape can be categorized into three primary segments:

#### 2.1.1 Professional Collaboration Tools

**Examples**: Asana, Trello, ClickUp

**Focus**: Project management, team workflows, corporate tasks.

**Social Features**: Extremely strong for teams (assigning tasks, comments, deadlines) but overly complex and "corporate" for personal friends.

**Our Position**: We are not competing with these. They are for "work," we are for "life."

#### 2.1.2 General Productivity Applications

**Examples**: Todoist, Microsoft To Do, TickTick

**Focus**: Powerful personal task management.

**Social Features**: They offer basic list/project sharing. You can share a grocery list, but the social aspect is purely functional, lacking a motivational layer.

**Our Position**: We will be simpler than these in personal task management but infinitely stronger in social motivation.

#### 2.1.3 Direct Social Task Applications

**Habitica**: A key competitor that "gamifies" tasks into an RPG. This creates powerful social accountability but may not appeal to all users.

**WeDo**: Shared To-Do Lists: A direct, simple competitor focused on real-time list sharing for families. It is functional but lacks a strong motivational hook.

### 2.2 Market Gap and Research Opportunity

The market is missing an app that sits between the functional-but-boring Todoist and the highly-gamified-but-niche Habitica. Our opportunity is to build an app that is simple, elegant, and uses social accountability as its core motivator. We aren't just showing a shared list; we are building a culture of shared accomplishment. This is where AI becomes our "killer feature."

## 3. Methodology

This section details the recommended technologies to build, deploy, and scale the application.

### 3.1 Client-Side Architecture (Frontend)

#### 3.1.1 Framework Selection

**Framework**: Flutter

**Rationale**: As specified, Flutter is the ideal choice. It allows for a single Dart codebase to be compiled natively for iOS and Android. This drastically reduces development time and ensures a consistent UI/UX. Its widget-based architecture is perfect for building the reactive UIs we need.

#### 3.1.2 State Management

**Solution**: Riverpod

**Rationale**: Flutter apps require a robust state management solution. Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and flexible choice. It will allow us to cleanly manage dependencies (like our database service) and handle UI state (like a loading list) with minimal boilerplate.

### 3.2 Backend Architecture (Server-side)

#### 3.2.1 Platform Selection

**Platform**: Firebase (Backend-as-a-Service - BaaS)

**Rationale**: For an app requiring real-time data sync, user logins, and push notifications, Firebase is the most integrated and efficient solution for a Flutter app. The FlutterFire library provides deep integration.

#### 3.2.2 Core Services

**Cloud Firestore (Database)**: A NoSQL, real-time database. Its real-time listener (onSnapshot) will allow friends to see progress updates instantly.

**Firebase Authentication (Auth)**: A secure service for managing user sign-up and login (Email/Password, Google Sign-In, etc.).

**Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: For sending push notifications (e.g., "Your friend just completed a common task!").

### 3.3 Software Architecture Pattern

**Pattern**: Clean Architecture (simplified)

**Rationale**: To keep the app maintainable and testable, we will separate concerns into three main layers:

- **Data Layer**: Manages all communication with Firebase (e.g., TaskRepository that calls Firestore).
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and data models (e.g., a Task class, a User class).
- **Presentation Layer**: The Flutter UI (Widgets) and the State Management (Riverpod providers).

## 4. Data Model Design

### 4.1 Database Schema Architecture

A preliminary database design is crucial for ensuring scalability and query efficiency. The following schema represents the proposed Firestore NoSQL database structure:

```
/users/{userId}/
  - username: "string"
  - email: "string"
  - friend_list: ["friendUserId1", "friendUserId2"]
  
  /users/{userId}/personal_tasks/{taskId}/
    - text: "string"
    - completed: "bool"
    - createdAt: "timestamp"

/task_groups/{groupId}/
  - groupName: "string"
  - members: ["userId1", "userId2", "userId3"]
  - createdBy: "userId1"

  /task_groups/{groupId}/common_tasks/{commonTaskId}/
    - text: "string"
    - createdAt: "timestamp"
    - createdBy: "userId1"
    - completedBy: {  
        "userId1": true,
        "userId2": false,
        "userId3": true
      }
```

### 4.2 Schema Design Rationale

The **completedBy** map structure is critical for real-time UI updates. By storing completion status as a map of user IDs to boolean values, we can efficiently query and display which group members have completed each task without requiring additional database reads or complex queries.

## 6. AI-Driven Differentiation Strategy (Version 2.0)

### 6.1 Introduction to AI Integration

Our core "Common Task" feature is good, but AI will make it revolutionary. By integrating a generative AI API (like Google's Gemini), we can transform our app from a simple list manager into an intelligent task coach and group facilitator.

### 6.2 Smart Task Generation and Decomposition

**Feature**: A user types a vague goal into the "Common Task" group, such as: "We should plan a weekend hiking trip."

**AI Action (Gemini)**: The AI will parse this natural language and suggest a list of actionable sub-tasks (e.g., "Research hiking trails," "Pick a date," "Book campsite," etc.).

**Expected Outcome**: Reduced cognitive load on users by automatically breaking down complex goals into manageable steps.

### 6.3 The AI Group Motivator

**Feature**: An AI persona ("Sync") that monitors group progress and provides context-aware encouragement.

**AI Action (Gemini)**:

- **Proactive Nudges**: "Hey team! The 'Book campsite' task hasn't been completed yet, and the trip is next week. Who can jump on that?"
- **Progress Summaries**: "Great work today, everyone! ðŸš€ You collectively crushed 4 tasks. Special shout-out to [User 1] for finishing 3 tasks!"

**Expected Outcome**: Enhanced group motivation and accountability through timely, personalized interventions.

### 6.4 Intelligent Task Prioritization

**Feature**: A user can tap a "Prioritize My Day" button.

**AI Action (Gemini)**: The AI analyzes their personal tasks and "Common Task" commitments and suggests a top-3 priority list.

**Expected Outcome**: Improved task completion rates by helping users focus on the most important activities.

### 6.5 Technical Implementation

**Implementation Details**:

- We will use the **google_generative_ai** package in Flutter.
- When a user adds a task or asks for a summary, the app will make a secure API call to the Gemini **generateContent** endpoint.
- We will provide the AI with a carefully crafted system prompt to define its "Sync" persona.
- API calls will be optimized to minimize latency and ensure a responsive user experience.
